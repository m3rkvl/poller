## Reflection

   I saw a polling project somewhere and wanted to challenge myself to see if I'd be able to build it. While architecting the project I got really ambitious and tried to make the functionality as close to strawpoll as possible with Firebase. While working on this project I took my very first steps in TypeScript; Tailwind; and getting live updates from a database and managing it in the React state.
   
   I used TypeScript, React, React Router, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase. 
   
   I tried to use colors with meaning. For example, green represents creation of a poll; blue represents participation; purple represents viewing the results; and lastly, the admin page is the combination of all three.
